# update file 'SOURCE_FILE' with key/value substitutions described in CONFIG_FILE, and write the result
# out to DEST_FILE
#
# requires CONFIG_FILE SOURCE_FILE DEST_FILE
#
# expected CONFIG_FILE format is:
# "key1\tvalue1\n"
# "key2\tvalue2\n" ...
#
# ..and SOURCE_FILE should contain @key1 and @key2, etc to indicate the corresponding macro substitution targets.
