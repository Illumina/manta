- MANTA-61 add markdown-based user guide to build
- MANTA-30 initial integration of known variant tracing framework
v0.12
- MANTA-20 incorporate split-reads into quality score
- MANTA-42 SV finder mismatches various read pair / sv-candidate combinations
- MANTA-53 Enable --rescore option in runWorkflow.py
- MANTA-40 Don't call splicing-events in RNA-seq as deletions
- MANTA-20 include split read counts for short reads
- MANTA-44 Fix Rhodobacter analysis
v0.11
- Adjust all vcf output to pass vcf-validator
- MANTA-20 fix split read breakpoint location
v0.10.1
- Fix low-frequency assertion due to unexpected alignment pattern
v0.10
- MANTA-20 Limit split read counts to those uniquely supporting each allele,
where P(allele|read)>0.999
- MANTA-20 Add likelihood based QUAL,GQ scores to diploid output, adjust
thresholds of somatic output to incorporate ref pairs and split reads.
- MANTA-41 Fails when chrom name not in [a-zA-z0-9_-]+
- MANTA-25 Partial support for BWA-MEM SA split reads
- MANTA-36 Segfault on RNA-Seq BAM input
- MANTA-20 Combined reference spanning read and split read evidence per variant
- MANTA-20 Diploid vcf output for non-tumor sample, diploid genotype inference score still todo
- MANTA-39 prevent crash on large CIGAR deletions
- MANTA-20 split read evidence counts for all large spanning SVs
v0.9
- MANTA-20 preliminary work on this branch allows assembly skip and control of min indel candidate size and min indel score size
- MANTA-33 reduce SV graph ram requirement to ~1/3 of its previous value, increase all post-merge task memory requests.

on BWA-mem FFPE examples

distribution
- Large event assembly fixes

v0.7
- Add assembly of large-event breakends and basepair resolution SV reporting
- MANTA-19 Correctly parse large deletion reads from Isaac and incorporate this into discovery
v0.6

- Minor modifications to method based on FFPE testing.
v0.4
- POC somatic transloc output
v0.3
- POC translation of graph into candidate transloc vcf
v0.2
