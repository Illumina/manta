Manta Methods
=============

This directory contains documents describing Manta's primary methods
and any major experimental approaches. Methods documentation is
maintained in latex.

Each directory should contain a `makepdf.bash` script, which produces
a `methods.pdf` file as output (so constrained to facilite automated
testing of the latex source build). The build for each document should
only require the contents of the standard `texlive` package -- any
additional latex requirements should be included with the methods if
possible.
